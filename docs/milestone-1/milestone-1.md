# Milestone 1
## Division Of Labor
The division of labor in phase 1 is as follows:

  - **Name Of Data Type**: Your name
- Pages (Wireframes and HTML implementations)
  - **Create User**: Patrick Goss
  - **Login**: Patrick Goss
  - **Profile**: Dylan Toothaker

Notes: The create user and login pages were both completed by Patrick Goss 
because these pages are similar.
