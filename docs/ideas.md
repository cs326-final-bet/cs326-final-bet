# Inovative Idea
Our innovative idea is a fitness tracker applicaiton that will track a person runing or biking and allow them to claim the area they are running or biking in by connecting their path to create a closed loop. This application is unique compared to traditional fitness tracker apps because of the game aspect of claiming territory while running or biking. This will incentivize people to work out in new places and to work out longer in order to claim more territory and get a higher score. This application will also take a spin on the popular .io genre of online games (slither.io, paper.io, ... etc.) by having the similar functionality of claiming territory by closing loops but adding in a real life aspect. 

# Important Components
This app will operate on a user based system. Each person that signs up will have their own profile that will keep track of their user data (email, password, username) and each user will have to sign up with an email and create a username and password for verification. Profiles will also keep track of the users personal fitness statistics (number of workouts, total space claimed, duration of workouts) so they can see how long and consistantly they workout. This app will also support data on what routes have been run in an area and will display this by showing the area claimed on a map. The ability to comment on different routes will also be available through this application. Finally this app will have data on which route is most popular, users will have the ability to rate different routes they have ran or biked.
